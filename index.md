# About Me

<img src="https://caihanlin.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

This is **Yubo Huang (黄宇波)**.

I am an undergraduate student in the class of 2021 at the School of Civil Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University. I have hosted or participated in a number of extracurricular innovation and entrepreneurship training programs for college students, participated in a number of scientific researches by several teachers, and created my own concept of deep learning in structural engineering and researched this program on my own initiative. I have submitted and published more than 10 papers covering civil engineering, computer science and technology, and mathematical modeling, and have been invited as a reviewer for ICLR, ICME, ICPR, ICIC, and Energies. During my undergraduate years, I was awarded one invention patent; I received more than 20 awards, including 8 national awards. I was the head of the academic department of the Mathematical Modeling Association of Southwest Jiaotong University. I received the Certificate of Talent Evaluation in Industry and Information Technology (Mathematical Modeling).

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - ybforever[at] my.swjtu.edu.cn

## Research Interests

- [Internet of Everything](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=zh-CN&mauthors=label:internet_of_everything)
-Cross-fertilization of deep learning in civil engineering
-Multimodal large language models
-Multimodal interaction
-Information security

My main interest lies in the intersection of computer science and civil engineering, which I have proposed in three parts: computer simulation and prediction of concrete performance based on deep learning, optimization, and intelligent generation of structural engineering drawings based on a combination of CV and NLP, and vertical LLM+ embodied artificial intelligence agent method for large-scale construction. Although my current research is a bit "off-topic", I have been working hard to achieve AGI.
